# Asset Uploader

## Objectives:

- Upload image, multiple images and video
- Handle the upload logic and everything outside the component
- Handle errors outside the component
- Component only uploads the image or images or video and display a preview of it
- Styling for preview box and upload button must come from outside of the component
- A default preview box with set height and width must be there and once the asset is uploaded it should get populated by that asset
- Styles should go through css using class names
- This is a typescript based react component
- Should not use the default upload provided by the browser
- Style for upload button and preview box should come from outside through class and css
- Error checks should also be done outside the component

- Sample error :
  - Invalid format
